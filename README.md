# Forecasting
Forecasting is the process of making predictions or estimates about future events based on past and present data. It involves analyzing historical data patterns to identify trends, seasonality, and other factors that can help predict future outcomes. In business, forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making, resource allocation, and planning strategies.
